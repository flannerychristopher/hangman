<p>This project is a continuation of a Ruby project from the Odin Project. It began as <a href="https://github.com/flanthedev/the_odin_project/tree/master/hangman">a command line program</a> and I later made <a href="https://github.com/flanthedev/the_odin_project/tree/master/hangman_sinatra"> a Sinatra app.</a></p>

<p>This new repo is an effort to refactor and improve the code. Thanks for checking it out!</p>
